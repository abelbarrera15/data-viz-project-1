# About

### Background

The following work (which can be found at the HOME page by using the MENU bar at the top right) is meant to be a modern representation of Dr. John Snow'w famous cholera map of 1854. It was pivotal in allowing him to convince the relevant authorities that an outbreak was in fact happening. What's more, that there seemed to be a relationship to the pumps! Thus, with this evidence, Dr. Snow was able to improve the water sanitation and in doing so aid stop the epidemic. More information click [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak). A picture of the original map can be found [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg). Also known as the Broad Street cholera outbreak or Golden Square cholera outbreak, the epidemic took the life of 616 people. From a modern day perspective, the visualization Dr. Snow generated has become a staple of effective data visualization and was far ahead of it's time.

### Our Visualization

The visualization hopes to make Snow's original visual a bit more dynamic whilst showing some other attributes of the epidemic such as gender, age, and time. Thereafter, relating the newly associated attributes to time and location within the Cholera map.

# Design Process / Documentation

Before officially beginning the project I saught after to challenge myself. Not only is D3.js very new to me, but I more frequently see React.js used in the software industry. As such, my goal was to create these visualizations with React as the driver for d3. Come to find out it wasn't as simple as I expected, but it was a valueable learning process nevertheless. Using D3 and React together was the biggest challenge for the during the project.

### About the Project

This project was initiated by Prof. Khairi Reda at IUPUI's class H517. All data was collected provided by him and provided to me. It can be found [HERE](https://khreda.com/teaching/2020/H517/project1). The purpose for the of the project was to practice d3 and create an interactive data visualization that represented a modernization of John Snow's famous 1854 Broad Street Cholera Outbreak map. All direction and base needs of the project were driver by Prof. Reda. The code base serving this project simply looks to feed this mission.
